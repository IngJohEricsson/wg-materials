## Network

During the meeting onsite persons will all have access to the Ericsson Guest WIFI network. This network is available at all places within the Ericsson Facilities. SSID: EWA@GUEST, this is a network with a captive portal and access code that will be displayed in the room. The network is only IPv4 I hope that will not be an issue for any participant. The network has basic firewalling but has been tested to support UDP and TCP on bascially any port outgoing. It also allows peer to peer within the network using UDP and TCP, but block ICMP echo requests (ping) between nodes.

## Transportation

The easiest way to get to Stockholm City from Arlanda Airport is the [Arlanda Express](https://www.arlandaexpress.com). 

From Arlanda airport to Kista, the options are either a taxi (~30 min, 400-450 Sek) or the local train from Arlanda station to Helenelund station (23 min travel, departs every 30 min, 151 Sek) then a 5 min walk to the meeting venue.   

Stockholm's [Tunnelbana](https://sl.se/en/) is an extensive metro network that includes direct travel to Kista. There is a 10 min walk from the metro to the meeting venue. There are a number of ticket options, please see SL's web page. Each ticket allows travel on all SLs types of traffic, including changes of lines during 75 minutes, SL tickets are usable on the metro, local train, busses and some boats. 

Stockholm's [Pendeltåg](https://sl.se/en/) (local trains) provides an alternative travel between Kista and Stockholm City (15 min). Helenelund station is 5 min walk from meeting venue. Same type of tickets and cost as the metro. Stockholm City provides easy changing between Pendeltåg and Tunnelbana (Local trains and metro). Travel to Arlanda requires additional ticket which costs 120 Sek in addition to reguler SL tickets.  

Taxis in Stockholm can be costly, it is an open market where the drivers are free to set their own price, however there is an upper limit of the highest comparison price to be 500 sek. The current reasonable comparison price is in the range of 320-350 Sek. The taxis have a note on their passenger doors that look like below. So before entering the car, please check the big number to avoid paying to much. Taking or ordering a cab from the big providers is generally safe:

* Taxi Stockholm
* Sverige Taxi (former Taxi 020)
* Taxi Kurir
