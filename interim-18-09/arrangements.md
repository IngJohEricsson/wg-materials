This is the arrangements page for the QUIC Working Group's sixth Interim Face-to-Face meeting,
hosted by NetApp in New York City, NY, USA.

If you wish to observe the meeting but not actively participate, you are strongly urged to attend remotely.

Attendees should also note the [agenda](agenda.md), as some topics will be considered out-of-scope for this meeting.


## Schedule and Agenda

We'll be meeting Wednesday and Thursday, 19-20 September 2018. Meetings will begin at 9:30am and end at
approximately 5pm on each day (although we may choose to end earlier).

There will also be an interop event on 17-18 September (Monday and Tuesday).

285 Madison Ave \
New York, NY 10017 \
USA

The receptionist on the ground floor has a list with all registered attendees. Give them your name and say that you're there for the "IETF QUIC" meeting at NetApp. Take an elevator to the 19th floor (I *think* it was the 19th floor...)

There should be some drinks and possibly small snacks throughout the day. There won't be catered lunch, but we're in midtown, so no problem.


## Accommodation

NetApp NYC is located midtown, with many hotels nearby.
